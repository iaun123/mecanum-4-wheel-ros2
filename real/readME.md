# real robot concept
This robot is a 4-wheel mecanum drive system, designed for omnidirectional movement.  
It uses a Jetson Nano as the mini PC for processing and control.  

### Sensors:
- **Encoder** – For wheel odometry and speed measurement.  
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** – For orientation and motion tracking.  
- **LiDAR** – For 2D/3D mapping and obstacle detection.  
- **3D Camera** – For depth perception and advanced navigation.
